Markdown is a language we can use to make plain text look good. 

# Headings or Headers

We can create headings in Markdown using the hash symbol. We can lso create subheadings with multiple hashes. 

## Level two heading/header
### Level three heading 
#### Level four heading
##### Level five heading 
###### Level six heading 
 - ends at level six


# Styling Characters

We typically use **bold** and *italics* to style characters when we type something.
You can do both ***bold and italics***
We can also use underscores to __bold__ and _italicize_ words

bold - two asterisks 
italics- one asterisk 
both bold and italics- three asterisks

If you want to use stars, use only stars. The same is true for underscores. In other words, `be consistent`

# Links 
Markdown is a language that translates from plain text to another language called `HTML`. `HTML` is the language that _web pages_ are built with. 

We can use links in our notes to other pages by using square brackets. `[]`

## Images 

We can embed linked images using the same style.

*Add exclamation mark before square brackets to add image iteslf, not just links.

# Escape Characters

*This is some text*

\*This is some text\*
-  put a backslash before the symbol to make it show up in text

The escape character in markdown is the backslash(\\)  

# Lists 

-  🙈
-  🤫

* Can also use astertisks
	* press tab on a new item to create sub list
*press shift+tab, it will move back one level

1. Get your toothbrush
2. ~~Wet your toothbrush bristles~~ - two ~ ~ will get it to cross out 
3.  Put sufficient toothpaste on bristles
4. Have at it

## To-do list
- [x] get a **haircut**
- [ ] buy groceries
- [ ] go on a run


# Code Blocks

Code blocks allow us to type code and gave it styled. 

```python
name = "Audrey"
age = 16
print(name,age)
```

```swift
var name = "Audrey"
let age = 16
```

```markdown
# This is markdown

**This is bold** 
This is not 
```

# Tables

All tables must have a header row and at least on other row

| Name | Age | Coolness level | 
| ---  | ---: |---:|
| Audrey | 16 | S |
| Mr Ubial | 88 | `B` | 
| **Batman** | 28 | SSS
