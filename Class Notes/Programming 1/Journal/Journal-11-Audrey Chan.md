## Linear Search

> Hidden in one house is a treasure. Using human language, describe how you would use linear search to find the treasure. To help, try making a numbered, step-by-step procedure. Also, consider which house you would start and end at.


1. search the houses on each row - there are 4 houses with 3 rows
2.  starting with the upper left house - mushroom
3. use an `if` statement to search for the tresure
4.  if there is nothing move it moves onto the next house or row
5.   when the statement finds the treasure use `print` to display the house where it can be found.
