## Choose Your Own Adventure

> After spending an hour or two working on your CYOA, what has been your biggest challenge so far?

figuring out why the codes won't run. sometimes there's red on the code but it looks right to me and then needing to troubleshoot constantly. also figuring out how to structure codes so that there are different outcomes for each answer. 

> What's one thing you learned about variables, so far?

variables are case senstitive and cannot have spaces . it can only consist of numbers, alphabets and underscores. 

> What's one thing you learned about conditionals, so far?

if is very commonly used and can have different branches to them. `and, elif, else` 
there are lots of different ways to finish off an if expression
