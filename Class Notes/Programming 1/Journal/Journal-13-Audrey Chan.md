## Classes and Objects

> Imagine we're describing a tree. What properties would you use to describe a tree? (This is similar to the exercise that we did in class yesterday, finding ways to use properties to describe Pokemon.) You can use bullet points.

- Colour - e.g if they turn red or not 
- Leaf shape
- Height
- If they have fruit or not
- Coniferous or Deciduous trees
  

## Holidays

> What are your plans for the winter holidays?
