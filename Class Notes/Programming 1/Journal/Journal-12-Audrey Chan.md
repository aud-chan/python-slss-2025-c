## Selection Sort

> Given the following list, using selection sort, sort the indicated element. Outline the steps you would follow in a way similar to the notes.

```
The List:

-- indicates that this part of the list is already sorted
** indicates the element that you should sort

  --  --  **   3    4   5
[-11,  1, 55, 43, 100, 34]

First Comparison
 --  --  **   %%   4   5
[-11,  1, 55, 43, 100, 34]

current_number = 43
lowest_number = 55
lowest_index = 2

"current_num is lower than lowest! update lowest_num and lowest_index"

New values:
lowest_num = 43
lowest_index = 3

Second Comparison:
[ --  --  **  L   %%   5]
[-11,  1, 55, 43, 100, 34]
current_number = 100
lowest_number = 43
lowest_index = 3

"current_num is not less than 43, move on to the next one."

Third Comparison:
[--  --  **    L    4  %%  
[-11,  1, 55, 43, 100, 34]]
current_number = 34
lowest_number = 43
lowest_index = 3

"current_num is less than 43, update lowest_num and lowest_index"

New values:
lowest_num = 34
lowets_index = 5

Swap
--  --    **   %%   4   S
[-11,  1, 55, 43, 100, 34]

--    --  --  %%   4   5
[-11,  1, 34, 43, 100, 55]
```
