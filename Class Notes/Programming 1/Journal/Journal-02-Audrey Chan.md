# Notes - introduction
# 16 September
# Audrey Chan

# Create an algorithm to solve a problem
# Problem: Create our own chabot
#          MeGPT

# 1.Greet the user with a predetermined statement
greeting = "Hello! I am a chatbot."

# 1a. Print the greeting
print(greeting)

#2. Introduce the bot
print("My name is MeGPT.")
print("I'm not like the other guy.")
print("I am completely deterministic.")

#3. Wow the user with some maths
print("I bet you don't know what 8*8 is")
print("I can do it")
print(f"8*8 is actually {8*8}.")

print("What is pi squared?")
print("I'm smart, I can do it too.")
print (f"It is {3.14159265359**2}.")

#4. Make bot crash out
print("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." * 10)

# Get the name of the user, store it, and use it.
user_name= input("What's your name? ")
print(f"It's nice to meet you, {user_name}!")

food= input("What's your favourite food?")
print(f"{food} is a good choice.")

age= input("How old are you?")
print(f"{age}, that's cool")

sport= input("What is your favourite sport? ")
print(f"My favourite sport is {sport} too!")

print(f"Goodbye {user_name}!")

```



## Closing questions

> What emoji best describes how you feel in this class this week? Explain why you chose this one.

🫩 -  had two quizzes and a test this week, so I am ready for the weekend. This week in programming was fun, I learnt a new type of code and  got to test out different variables in the tutorial. 

> Any questions?

No questions for this week 😁
