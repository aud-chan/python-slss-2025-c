## Recursion

***Please use your brain for these, no LLMs. I'm not looking for right answers, just your answers.***

> There are two things that you need to make a recursive function.

`def` and `if` and `else` and `level-1`

This is recursive because it uses the previous answer to figure out what the next one is. It is a repeating sequence. 

> Consider the function below. How many times will it call itself not including the initial function call?

```python
def some_recursive_function(int):
	if num > 1:
		return num + some_recursive_function(num-1)
	else:
		return 0

result = some_recursive_function(10)
```

The function will call itself 9 times.
