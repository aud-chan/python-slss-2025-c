## Designing a Function

> In your `work-functions.py` file, create a function that calculates the average of three numbers. Here are the requirements in detail:
>
> * call it `average`
> * it should accept three parameters: `num_one`, `num_two`, and `num_three`
> * it should calculate the average value of the three numbers:
> 	* recall that to calculate the average, you add the values then divide by the number of values you have
> * return the result
>
>  *Optional*: write another version that accepts a list and returns the average of all things inside the list

> Test your function and copy and paste your code in the block below.

```python
def average(num_one, num_two, num_three):
    num_one = int(num_one)
    num_two = int(num_two)
    num_three = int(num_three)
    average = (num_one + num_two + num_three) / 3
    return average

result = average(79,76,71)
print(result)
```

## Using your function

> Use the function that you created above to calculate your average WPM and accuracy. What is your average over your three results?

WPM - 75.3
Accuracy - 92%
