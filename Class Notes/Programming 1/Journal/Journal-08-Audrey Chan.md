## Oh, we're halfway there...

> We're halfway through the semester. What thoughts do you have about programming so far?

It's fun but also challenging at times. Needing to adjust to the language and how things are interpreted. 

> What are some challenges that you've experienced?

Figuring out the levels for the trees because the needing to -1 level each time was confusing for me  

> What are some cool things that you've done?

I drew a simple city with some buildings and stars.  The cookie was also fun too.  

> In the remainder of the course, we'll look at Object Oriented Programming, communicating with APIs, and explore a little bit of game design. Are there any other ideas related to programming/computer science that you want to explore?

Not in particular

> Are you a better typer?

Yes but I prefer the keyboard on my macbook over this one so it slows me down a bit. 

> Thank you!
